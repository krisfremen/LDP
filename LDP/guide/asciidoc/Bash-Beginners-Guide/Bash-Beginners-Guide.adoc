Bash Guide for Beginners

Why this guide?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The primary reason for writing this document is that a lot of readers
feel the existing
http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html[HOWTO] to be too short
and incomplete, while the http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/[Bash Scripting]
guide is too much of a reference work. There is nothing in between these
two extremes. I also wrote this guide on the general principle that not
enough free basic courses are available, though they should be.

This is a practical guide which, while not always being too serious,
tries to give real-life instead of theoretical examples. I partly wrote
it because I don't get excited with stripped down and over-simplified
examples written by people who know what they are talking about, showing
some really cool Bash feature so much out of its context that you cannot
ever use it in practical circumstances. You can read that sort of stuff
after finishing this book, which contains exercises and examples that
will help you survive in the real world.

From my experience as UNIX/Linux user, system administrator and trainer,
I know that people can have years of daily interaction with their
systems, without having the slightest knowledge of task automation. Thus
they often think that UNIX is not user-friendly, and even worse, they
get the impression that it is slow and old-fashioned. This problem is
another one that can be remedied by this guide.

Who should read this book?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Everybody working on a UNIX or UNIX-like system who wants to make life
easier on themselves, power users and sysadmins alike, can benefit from
reading this book. Readers who already have a grasp of working the
system using the command line will learn the ins and outs of shell
scripting that ease execution of daily tasks. System administration
relies a great deal on shell scripting; common tasks are often automated
using simple scripts. This document is full of examples that will
encourage you to write your own and that will inspire you to improve on
existing scripts.

Prerequisites/not in this course:

* You should be an experienced UNIX or Linux user, familiar with basic
commands, man pages and documentation
* Being able to use a text editor
* Understand system boot and shutdown processes, init and initscripts
* Create users and groups, set passwords
* Permissions, special modes
* Understand naming conventions for devices, partitioning,
mounting/unmounting file systems
* Adding/removing software on your system

See http://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/[Introduction to Linux] (or
your local http://www.tldp.org/mirrors.html[TLDP mirror]) if you haven't
mastered one or more of these topics. Additional information can be
found in your system documentation (man and info pages), or at
http://tldp.org[the Linux Documentation Project].

Thanks to all the friends who helped (or tried to) and to my husband;
your encouraging words made this work possible. Thanks to all the people
who submitted bug reports, examples and remarks - among many, many
others:

* Hans Bol, one of the groupies
* Mike Sim, remarks on style
* Dan Richter, for array examples
* Gerg Ferguson, for ideas on the title
* Mendel Leo Cooper, for making room
* #linux.be, for keeping my feet on the ground

Special thanks to Tabatha Marshall, who volunteered to do a complete
review and spell and grammar check. We make a great team: she works when
I sleep. And vice versa ;-)

What do you need?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`bash`, available from http://www.gnu.org/directory/GNU/. The Bash shell
is available on nearly every Linux system, and can these days be found
on a wide variety of UNIX systems.

Compiles easily if you need to make your own, tested on a wide variety
of UNIX, Linux, MS Windows and other systems.
